##Guinea Pig
In this exercise, we used event listeners more thoroughly. Most of my elements include a click event listener. I also had the opportunity to use element.classList.add, which I had not used before, to style the page.

##How to Run
After pulling the code, navigate to your terminal and run http-server -p 4040.

Then, in your browser, navigate to 127.0.0.1:4040.
